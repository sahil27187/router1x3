# Router 1X3 Project

A high-performance 1x3 router designed and implemented using Vivado, featuring synthesis, simulation, and code coverage analysis.  
This project consists of four key modules: FIFO, synchronizer, register, and FSM, ensuring efficient and reliable data routing.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📥 Routes a single input data stream to one of three outputs with optimized control logic.
- 🛠️ Modular design with four submodules: FIFO, synchronizer, register, and FSM.
- ⚡ Fully synthesized and simulated in Vivado with comprehensive code coverage.
- 🔧 Configurable logic supporting dynamic packet routing based on control signals.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Verilog:** HDL used for designing the router.
- **Vivado:** Used for synthesis, simulation, and verification.
- **Testbenches:** Ensuring correctness through rigorous verification.
- **Digital Design Principles:** Applied for efficient routing and logic implementation.

## 📜 Design Overview
The 1x3 router efficiently routes incoming data packets to one of three designated output channels.  
Its modular design consists of the following core components:

- **FIFO:** Handles temporary data storage for smooth processing.
- **Synchronizer:** Ensures reliable data transfer across different clock domains.
- **Register:** Provides temporary storage for efficient data management.
- **FSM:** Implements intelligent control logic for dynamic packet routing.
